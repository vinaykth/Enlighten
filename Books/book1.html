Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the late John Golding for his inspirational teaching, and also the multitude of other artists whose names cannot all be mentioned in the con- fines of this book but whose work has been an ongoing source of stimulation and enjoyment to me. For the first edition, I was indebted to my commissioning edi- tor, Nikos Stangos and team; to the staff of the Tate library; to Christopher Green and Sarah Wilson for their comments on the manuscript; and to Lynne Cooke and Tony Godfrey for their helpful discussions. For the current edition, I would like to extend thanks to Andrea Schlieker; to Roger Thorp and team at Thames & Hudson; to all those who kindly gave illustrations; and to Anne Farrer, Katie Hill, Iain Robertson, Pierre Saurisse and Marcus Verhagen for their valuable com- ments on new text. Any errors remaining are my own. Thanks also to my family, not least my husband Colin Ludlow for his ongoing support and encouragement as well as editing help in the preparation of both editions. Thirty years on, the book is gratefully rededicated to him.
