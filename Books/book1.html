Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the late John Golding for his inspirational teaching, and also the multitude of other artists whose names cannot all be mentioned in the con- fines of this book but whose work has been an ongoing source of stimulation and enjoyment to me. For the first edition, I was indebted to my commissioning edi- tor, Nikos Stangos and team; to the staff of the Tate library; to Christopher Green and Sarah Wilson for their comments on the manuscript; and to Lynne Cooke and Tony Godfrey for their helpful discussions. For the current edition, I would like to extend thanks to Andrea Schlieker; to Roger Thorp and team at Thames & Hudson; to all those who kindly gave illustrations; and to Anne Farrer, Katie Hill, Iain Robertson, Pierre Saurisse and Marcus Verhagen for their valuable com- ments on new text. Any errors remaining are my own. Thanks also to my family, not least my husband Colin Ludlow for his ongoing support and encouragement as well as editing help in the preparation of both editions. Thirty years on, the book is gratefully rededicated to him.

          Preface
Abstract art has frequently baffled many people, largely because it seems unre- lated to the world of appearances. Like other modernist art, it poses difficulties of understanding and judgment, and calls into question the very nature of art. Unlike portrait or landscape paintings, which are believed to represent the world, abstract painting apparently refers only to invisible, inner states or simply to it- self. It thus challenges the spectator and raises puzzling questions: What is this kind of art about? Is it art, or is it mere decoration? What is it trying to say (or do), and how is one supposed to react to it? What criteria can be used to evaluate it? Why did artists during the twentieth century choose to turn their backs on the commonly perceived world, which, after all, seems to have served earlier artists perfectly well for centuries? Is depiction an accurate record of perceived reality in the first place? What is, in terms of art, an accurate record?
In fact, abstract art exists in varying degrees and forms. Some abstract art is 'abstracted' from nature; its starting point is the 'real' world. The artist selects a form and then simplifies it until the image bears only stylized similarities to the original, or is changed almost entirely beyond recognition. This tendency has been evident in the art of many cultures throughout history, but even within the representational tradition that dominated Western art from the Renaissance, artists have always been aware of the gap between depicted image and reality, and of the artist's role in transforming perceived reality into art. It was not until the early years of the twentieth century, however, that an abstract art with no apparent connection to the external world began to emerge. This new, 'non-rep- resentational mode provided a thorough-going challenge to the depictive tradi- tion, governed since the Renaissance by the rules of single-point perspective, and during the course of the twentieth century it was refined and developed in a star- tling variety of ways.
The evolution towards this kind of abstract art did not occur in isolation but was only one aspect of the social, intellectual and technological upheaval that took place at the turn of the twentieth century. From the discovery of X-rays to the development of the motor car, science helped to create very different percep- tions of the world. As the artist Fernand LÃ©ger declared in 1914, 'if pictorial ex- pression has changed, it is because modern life has made this necessary."
Central to the spirit of modernism which this comment reflects was an
avant-garde attitude that permeated all the arts. Artists sought new ways of re-
sponding to the world around them, sometimes by rejecting it, or by pursuing
strategies of dissolution, flux and fracture in place of traditional Western no-
tions of aesthetic unity and wholeness. The search for new strategies led to a
